# Book List Manager  

## Objective  
To create a simple web application that allows users to manage a list of books. Users should be able to add, view, update, and delete books. The application will use Angular for the frontend and ASP.NET with C# for the backend.  

## Requirements  

### Frontend (Angular):  
- Create a user interface to display the list of books.  
- Provide a form to add new books.  
- Allow users to edit and delete existing books.  

### Backend (ASP.NET with C#):  
- Create a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for books.  
- Use a simple in-memory list to store the books.  
- Book model properties:  
  - `id`  
  - `title`  
  - `author`  
  - `isbn`  
  - `publicationDate`  

## Technologies  

### Frontend:  
- **HTML:** Structure the application interface.  
- **CSS:** Style the interface for a better user experience.  
- **JavaScript & Angular:** Create dynamic and responsive web components.  

### Backend:  
- **ASP.NET Core:** Build and manage the backend API.  
- **C#:** Implement logic for CRUD operations.
